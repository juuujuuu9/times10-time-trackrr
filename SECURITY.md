## Security Issue Resolved (2024)

### Issue: Exposed Middleware Secret
**Date**: December 2024  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Resolved

#### Problem
The `.vercel` build directory was being tracked in Git, which contained compiled build artifacts with exposed middleware secrets:
- `middlewareSecret: "45d5afad-7ff9-46c2-ab93-a034fa245d5e"`
- Previous secrets that were also exposed: `"092c9e02-278b-44a3-a2c7-891534cfb858"`, `"bcd7be99-b419-4a5b-9ff5-ca28ea80b136"`

#### Root Cause
Build artifacts from Vercel deployment were accidentally committed to the repository, exposing internal Astro middleware secrets that are generated during the build process.

#### Resolution
1. **Removed build artifacts from Git tracking**:
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .vercel
   ```

2. **Updated `.gitignore`** to prevent future commits of build artifacts:
   ```
   # vercel build output
   .vercel/
   ```

3. **Committed the security fix** to remove exposed secrets from the repository.

#### Prevention Measures
- ✅ `.vercel/` directory is now properly ignored
- ✅ `dist/` directory is ignored (build output)
- ✅ `.astro/` directory is ignored (generated types)
- ✅ Environment variables are properly used for sensitive configuration
- ✅ Database connection uses environment variables only

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive configuration should use environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` for documentation of required variables

### Build Artifacts
- Never commit build directories (`.vercel/`, `dist/`, `.astro/`)
- Build artifacts should be generated during deployment, not stored in Git
- Use CI/CD pipelines to handle builds securely

### Database Security
- Database URLs should always be environment variables
- Use connection pooling and proper authentication
- Regularly rotate database credentials

### API Security
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- [ ] No build artifacts committed
- [ ] Environment variables used for configuration
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Authentication/authorization in place
- [ ] HTTPS used in production

## Monitoring
- Regularly scan for exposed secrets using GitHub's secret scanning
- Monitor for security alerts and address them promptly
- Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
