// Debug script for subtask assignment issues
console.log('🔍 Debugging Subtask Assignment Email Issues\n');

console.log('📋 The Real Problem:');
console.log('❌ Task assignments use USER IDs (reliable)');
console.log('❌ Subtask assignments use USER NAMES (unreliable)');
console.log('❌ Name matching often fails due to spaces, case, encoding');

console.log('\n🔧 What I Fixed:');
console.log('✅ Added .trim() to remove extra spaces');
console.log('✅ Enhanced logging to show user lookup results');
console.log('✅ Better error messages for debugging');

console.log('\n🧪 Test Steps:');
console.log('1. Go to your collaborations page');
console.log('2. Assign a user to a subtask');
console.log('3. Check browser console for these logs:');

console.log('\n📝 Console Logs to Look For:');
console.log('✅ "PUT subtask API called" - API is being called');
console.log('✅ "📧 Attempting to send subtask assignment email to {email} (found user: {name})" - User found and email triggered');
console.log('✅ "📧 Subtask assignment email sent to {email}" - Email sent successfully');
console.log('❌ "📧 Skipping email for user \\"{name}\\" - User lookup failed" - User not found by name');
console.log('❌ "📧 Skipping email for user \\"{name}\\" - Found user: null" - User lookup completely failed');

console.log('\n🔍 Common Issues:');
console.log('1. User name has extra spaces: "John Doe " vs "John Doe"');
console.log('2. Case differences: "john doe" vs "John Doe"');
console.log('3. User name doesn\'t exist in database');
console.log('4. User has no email address');

console.log('\n💡 If User Lookup Still Fails:');
console.log('1. Check the exact user name in the database');
console.log('2. Verify the user has an email address');
console.log('3. Check for special characters or encoding issues');
console.log('4. Consider switching to user ID-based assignment (like tasks)');

console.log('\n🚀 Next Steps:');
console.log('1. Test subtask assignment in production');
console.log('2. Check console logs for the new detailed messages');
console.log('3. If still failing, we may need to switch to ID-based assignment');
