# Times10 Time Tracker

A modern time tracking application built with Astro, React, and PostgreSQL. Focus on simple, efficient time entry with flexible duration formats and role-based access control.

## 🔐 Authentication & User Roles

The application now supports a comprehensive authentication system with three user roles and email invitations for team onboarding.

### Team Invitations

Admins can invite new team members by:
1. Going to the Team Members page (`/admin/users`)
2. Clicking "Invite Team Member"
3. Filling out the invitation form with name, email, role, and pay rate
4. The invitee receives an email with a secure link to set up their account
5. The invitee clicks the link and creates their password
6. Their account is activated and they can log in

**Invitation Features:**
- Secure invitation tokens that expire in 24 hours
- Professional email templates with Times10 branding
- Automatic account activation upon password setup
- Status tracking (invited → active)

### User Roles

   - Access to admin dashboard at `/admin`
   - Can view all reports and system settings

2. **Manager** (`manager`)
   - Team oversight capabilities
   - View team members and their activities
   - Manage projects and assign tasks
   - Access to manager dashboard at `/manager`

3. **User** (`user`)

- **User**: `user@times10.com` / `user123`

## 🕐 Time Entry Features

The application supports simple time entry with various duration formats:

- **Hours**: `2h`, `2hr`, `3.5hr`, `2hours`
