## üîß Setup Requirements

### For Real-time Notifications (1-8, 11)
These notifications are triggered automatically when the corresponding actions occur. No additional setup is required.

### For Scheduled Notifications (9-10)
These require a cron job or scheduled task to be set up:

1. **Cron Job Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Run daily at 9 AM
   0 9 * * * cd /path/to/app && node scripts/run-scheduled-notifications.js
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   ```

3. **Manual Testing**:
   ```bash
   # Test the endpoint
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:4321/api/scheduled-notifications"
   
   # Run the script
   node scripts/run-scheduled-notifications.js
   ```

## üìß Email Configuration

All notifications use the existing email infrastructure:
- **Service**: Resend
- **Configuration**: `src/utils/emailConfig.ts`
- **Base URL**: Configured via `getEmailBaseUrl()`
- **Templates**: Consistent styling with brand colors

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Error Handling

- **Authentication**: All endpoints require proper user authentication
- **Permission Checks**: Users can only trigger notifications for tasks they have access to
- **Error Handling**: Email failures don't break the main operation
- **Logging**: All notification attempts are logged for debugging
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for production use

## üìä Monitoring

### Check Notification Status
```bash
# View application logs
tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep "üìß"

# Test specific endpoints
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/scheduled-notifications"
```

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable for detailed logging:
```bash
export DEBUG_NOTIFICATIONS=true
```
