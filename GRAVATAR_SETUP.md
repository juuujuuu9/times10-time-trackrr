# Gravatar Setup for Sender Avatars

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### **Option 1: Use a Real Email Address (Recommended)**

Since you can't verify a `noreply` email, use a real email you can access:

1. **Go to Gravatar.com**
   - Visit [https://gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com)
   - Click "Create Your Own Gravatar"

2. **Create Account**
   - Use a real email: `support@trackr.times10.net` or `yourname@trackr.times10.net`
   - Create a password
   - Verify your email address

3. **Update Your Email Config**
   ```typescript
   // In emailConfig.ts
   senderEmail: 'support@trackr.times10.net', // Use the email you verified
   ```

### **Option 2: Use Your Personal Email**

If you don't have access to `support@trackr.times10.net`:

1. **Use your personal email** (like `yourname@gmail.com`)
2. **Set up Gravatar** with that email
3. **Update the config**:
   ```typescript
   senderEmail: 'yourname@gmail.com', // Your personal email
   ```

### **3. Upload Your Avatar**
- Click "Add a new image"
- Upload your `avatar.jpg` file
- Crop/resize as needed (Gravatar will show you previews)
- Rate the image (G for general audiences)

### **4. Assign to Email**
- Make sure the image is assigned to `noreply@trackr.times10.net`
- Set it as your primary image

### **5. Test**
- Send a test email
- Check in Gmail, Outlook, etc.
- Avatar should appear within a few minutes

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Use a Different Email Address

If you can't use `noreply@trackr.times10.net` for Gravatar, you can:

### **Option A: Use a Real Email Address**
```typescript
// In emailConfig.ts
senderEmail: 'support@trackr.times10.net', // Use a real email you can access
```

### **Option B: Use a Personal Email**
```typescript
// In emailConfig.ts  
senderEmail: 'yourname@trackr.times10.net', // Your personal email
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Your Setup

### **1. Send Test Email**
Visit `/api/test-email` to send a test email

### **2. Check Email Clients**
- **Gmail**: Avatar should appear next to sender name
- **Outlook**: Check both web and desktop versions
- **Apple Mail**: Test on Mac and iOS
- **Mobile apps**: Check Gmail app, Outlook app

### **3. Verify Gravatar**
- Go to [https://en.gravatar.com/site/check/noreply@trackr.times10.net](https://en.gravatar.com/site/check/noreply@trackr.times10.net)
- Should show your uploaded avatar

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### **Avatar Still Not Showing**
1. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Gravatar can take time to propagate
2. **Clear email client cache** - Some clients cache avatars
3. **Check Gravatar URL** - Make sure it's assigned to the correct email
4. **Try different email client** - Test in multiple clients

### **Gravatar Not Working**
1. **Verify email address** - Make sure it matches exactly
2. **Check image rating** - Use G-rated images
3. **Confirm assignment** - Image must be assigned to the email
4. **Check image format** - Use JPG, PNG, or GIF

### **Alternative Solutions**
If Gravatar doesn't work, you can:

1. **Use a real email address** that you can access
2. **Set up the email in your contacts** with a photo
3. **Use a different sender email** that has Gravatar set up

### **Option 3: No Gravatar (Simplest)**

If you don't want to deal with Gravatar at all:

1. **Keep using `noreply@trackr.times10.net`**
2. **Email clients will show initials** (like "TT" for "Times10 Trackr")
3. **Still looks professional** - many companies do this
4. **No setup required** - works immediately

```typescript
// In emailConfig.ts - keep it simple
senderEmail: 'noreply@trackr.times10.net',
```
