## ⏰ Time Period Filtering

### Available Periods
- **📅 All Time**: No date filtering
- **📅 Today**: Current day only
- **📅 This Week**: Sunday to Saturday of current week
- **📅 This Month**: Current month
- **📅 This Quarter**: Current quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)

### How It Works
1. **Select Period**: Choose from dropdown in top-right of tab container
2. **Server Processing**: Data is filtered at database level
3. **Page Reload**: Page reloads with filtered data
4. **URL Persistence**: Selected period is maintained in URL

## 🔍 Client Filtering System

### How Client Filtering Works
1. **Independent Tabs**: Each tab can have different client filters
2. **Server-Side Processing**: Filtering happens at database level
3. **URL Parameters**: Filters are maintained in URL
4. **Easy Switching**: All clients remain visible in dropdowns

### Client Filter Behavior
- **Team Tab**: Filter by `teamClient` parameter
- **Project Tab**: Filter by `projectClient` parameter  
- **Client Tab**: No client filtering (shows all clients)

### Switching Between Clients
1. **Direct Selection**: Select any client from dropdown
2. **No Reset Required**: Don't need to go back to "All Clients"
3. **Instant Results**: Page reloads with filtered data
4. **URL Updates**: New filter is saved in URL

## 🎯 Filtering Combinations

### Time Period + Client Filtering
- **Combined Filtering**: Both filters work together
- **Accurate Results**: Only shows data matching both criteria
- **Independent Tabs**: Each tab maintains its own client filter

### Example Scenarios
1. **"This Week" + "Client A" in Team Tab**: Shows team members who worked for Client A this week
2. **"This Month" + "Client B" in Project Tab**: Shows projects for Client B this month
3. **"Today" + No client filter in Client Tab**: Shows all clients' work for today

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Processing
- **Server-Side Filtering**: All filtering happens at database level
- **Separate Queries**: Each tab uses independent data queries
- **Efficient Processing**: Only relevant data is queried and processed

### URL Parameters
- `period`: Time period selection (today, week, month, quarter)
- `teamClient`: Client filter for Team tab
- `projectClient`: Client filter for Project tab

### Performance Benefits
- **Database Efficiency**: Only relevant data is queried
- **Reduced Data Transfer**: Smaller result sets
- **Faster Rendering**: Less data to process on client side

## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Managers
1. **Start with Time Period**: Select the time range you want to analyze
2. **Use Client Filters**: Focus on specific clients in Team/Project tabs
3. **Check Client Overview**: Use Client tab to see all clients at once
4. **Bookmark URLs**: Save specific filter combinations as bookmarks

### For Analysts
1. **Compare Periods**: Change time period to compare different time ranges
2. **Focus Analysis**: Use client filters to drill down into specific clients
3. **Export Data**: Use URL parameters to share specific views
4. **Track Trends**: Monitor changes across different time periods

### Best Practices
- **Use Client Tab for Overview**: Always shows all clients
- **Use Team Tab for Resource Planning**: See who worked on what
- **Use Project Tab for Project Analysis**: Focus on specific projects
- **Combine Filters**: Use time period + client filters for detailed analysis

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No Data Showing**: Check if time period has data
2. **Client Not Appearing**: Verify client has work in selected time period
3. **Filters Not Working**: Check URL parameters are correct
4. **Slow Loading**: Large time periods may take longer to process

### Solutions
- **Try Different Time Periods**: Some periods may have no data
- **Check Client Selection**: Ensure client has work in selected period
- **Refresh Page**: Reload if filters seem stuck
- **Use Smaller Time Periods**: For better performance with large datasets
